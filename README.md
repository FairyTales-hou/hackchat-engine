# hackchat-engine

A NodeJS and browser friendly JavaScript library used to interact with a hackchat server.

This readme will be updated soon, I don't want to get distracted, sorry. This engine is used in the saga of the CommunicationProvider container of the version 2 client. An example can also be found in the test.js file of this repo.

# Note:
If this note is in place, it means that I've either forgotten to remove it or that this engine is currently not supported by the main server at https://hack.chat/ . The server needs to be updated still. . .
